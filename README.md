# Applied Machine Learning: Foundations
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Applied Machine Learning: Foundations. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

## Getting Started

This project can be set up and run in two ways: using GitHub Codespaces for a cloud-based environment, or locally on your machine by installing the required dependencies. Follow the instructions below to get started with the method that best suits your needs.

### Option 1: Using GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides a complete, configurable dev environment on top of a powerful VS Code interface. It's an excellent option for quickly starting development without the need to set up your local environment.

1. **Open the project in Codespaces:** Navigate to the GitHub page of the project and click the "Code" button. Select "Open with Codespaces" > "New codespace". This will set up a new cloud-based development environment pre-configured for this project.

2. **Wait for installation:** The installation takes a few minutes after the Codespace launches. The terminal at the bottom of VSCode will be spinning for a little bit getting all of the dependencies built and installed.

3. **Open up `ml-foundations.ipynb` in VSCode:** The video will walk you through this. 

### Option 2: Local Setup

If you prefer to work on your local machine, follow these steps to set up the project environment. You'll need Python installed on your system (refer to [python.org](https://www.python.org/) for installation instructions).

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
   cd your-project-name
   ```
2. **Create virtual environment:** Using your favorite mechanism, create a virtual environment for Python.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have your virtual environment activated. Then, install the required packages using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter and open `ml-foundations.ipynb`:**
   With the dependencies installed, you're ready to launch Juypter:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

   Navigate and open the `ml-foundations.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
